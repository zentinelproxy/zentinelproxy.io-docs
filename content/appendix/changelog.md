## Upgrading

### From 0.9.x to 1.0.0

No breaking changes. Direct upgrade supported.

```bash

systemctl stop sentinel

# Install new version
curl -Lo /usr/local/bin/sentinel \
    https://github.com/raskell-io/sentinel/releases/download/v1.0.0/sentinel

# Validate configuration
sentinel validate -c /etc/sentinel/sentinel.kdl

# Start new version
systemctl start sentinel
```

### From 0.8.x to 0.9.x

Configuration changes required:

1. **Health check syntax changed**:
   ```kdl
   // Old (0.8.x)
   upstream "backend" {
       health-check "/health"
   }

   // New (0.9.x)
   upstream "backend" {
       health-check {
           path "/health"
           interval-secs 10
       }
