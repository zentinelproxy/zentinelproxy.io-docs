Welcome to **Zentinel**, a high-performance **reverse proxy** platform built on [Cloudflare's Pingora](https://github.com/cloudflare/pingora) framework. Zentinel extends Pingora's robust foundation with enterprise-grade features designed for modern web infrastructure.

## What is Zentinel?

Zentinel is a next-generation reverse proxy that combines the performance and reliability of Pingora with advanced routing capabilities, service-type awareness, and comprehensive error handling. Whether you're serving static files, proxying REST APIs, or managing complex web applications, Zentinel provides the tools and flexibility you need for production deployments.

## Key Features

### High Performance
- Built on Pingora's async Rust foundation
- Memory-safe architecture with zero-copy operations
- Efficient connection pooling and keep-alive management
- Optimized for both throughput and latency

### Service-Type Awareness
Zentinel understands different service types and optimizes behavior accordingly:

- **Web Applications**: HTML error pages, session handling, SPA support
- **REST APIs**: JSON schema validation, structured error responses, OpenAPI integration
- **Static Files**: Direct file serving, automatic MIME types, caching headers

### Advanced Routing
- Flexible path-based and host-based routing
- Route priorities and groups
- Path variables and pattern matching
- Per-route configuration overrides

### Comprehensive Error Handling
- Service-type-specific error formats (HTML, JSON, XML, Text)
- Custom error page templates with variable substitution
- Graceful fallbacks for connection failures
- Detailed error tracking with request IDs

### Observability
- Structured logging with configurable levels
- Prometheus-compatible metrics
- Distributed tracing support
- Health check endpoints

### Security Features
- Path traversal protection for static files
- Request validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting capabilities
- TLS/SSL with modern cipher suites
- HTTP/3 preparation with QUIC support (ready for activation)

### Configuration
- Human-friendly KDL configuration format
- Hot reload without downtime
- Environment variable substitution
- Comprehensive validation on startup

## Why Zentinel?

### Production-Ready
Zentinel is designed for production use from the ground up. Every feature is implemented with reliability, performance, and operational excellence in mind.

### Type-Safe and Memory-Safe
Written in Rust, Zentinel eliminates entire classes of bugs common in traditional proxies, including buffer overflows, use-after-free errors, and data races.

### Cloud-Native
Built for modern cloud environments with support for:
- Container deployments (Docker, Kubernetes)
- Horizontal scaling
- Service mesh integration
- Dynamic configuration

### Developer-Friendly
- Clear, expressive configuration
- Comprehensive error messages
- Extensive documentation
- Example configurations for common use cases

## Use Cases

Zentinel excels in various deployment scenarios:

- **API Gateway**: Validate requests, transform responses, implement rate limiting
- **Static Content Delivery**: Serve files directly with optimal caching headers
- **Load Balancer**: Distribute traffic across multiple upstream servers
- **Web Application Proxy**: Handle sessions, provide custom error pages, support SPAs
- **Microservices Router**: Route requests to different services based on paths
- **Edge Proxy**: Terminate SSL, implement security policies, cache responses

## Architecture Highlights

Zentinel leverages Pingora's battle-tested architecture while adding its own innovations:
